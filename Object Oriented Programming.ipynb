A class is a blueprint for how an object can be created. For example, a video game can have players, vehicles, and weapons as objects. Our video game could have 5 people each on two teams, but each one of those people are created from the same blueprint/class. Rather than writing the same lines of code for 5 different people, you write a blueprint and create each person from that blueprint.\n","\n","Before we can use some objects we must create them. More precisely, we must create an **instance** of the object's class. The process of creating an object is called **instantiation** but it can be helpful to just think of this as fancy term for creating something.\n","\n","In the lessons we have covered so far, Python automatically created objects such as numbers, strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries. The programmer must explicitly instantiate other classes of objects.\n","***\n","\n","### General Syntax\n","To create a class we use the `class` keyword followed by the name of the class and `()` followed by any method definitions, attributes, and properties. Below is the general syntax:\n","```\n","class NameOfClass():\n","  \n","  def __init__(self, parameter1, parameter2):\n","    self.parameter1 = parameter1\n","    self.parameter2 = parameter2\n","\n","  def some_method(self):\n","    # perform some action\n","    print(self.parameter1)\n","```\n","#### The built-in `__init__()` Function\n","Notice the first function uses a special function: `__init__(self, parameter1, parameter2)`. This function is automatically called when the class is being initiated. We use the `__init__()` function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created.\n",">- Notice the *self* parameter again in the `__init__()` function. Recall the *self* parameter is a reference to the current instance of the class, and it is used to access variables that belong to the class. We will continue to work on what this does with some examples.\n","\n","Once the class is created, the general syntax instantiating a class and assigning the resulting object to a variable is as follows:\n","\n","```\n","variable_name = NameOfClass(parameter1, parameter2)\n","```\n",">- Example: `person1 = Person(height, weight)`\n","\n","The expression on the right side of the assignement is called a **constructor** and is similar to a function call.
